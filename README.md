# Unit 18 React Homework: Budget Tracker

## Overview

For this assignment, I attempted to create a budget tracker with React. I broke up my application's UI into components, managed component state, and responded to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view all my expenses so that I have access to them and can see the total of my entered expenses.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

The application renders on a single page with:

  * A form to input a budget item and the corresponding expense.

  * A table of all expenses.

  In the future, this app will feature a running total of expenses at the bottom of the table.
  
A user should be able to input an expense, consisting of: 

  * A dollar amount
